## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- BEM

### What I learned

I learned BEM for the first time.

CSS background-position and background-size property basics.

```css
background: url('./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg') left top/100% no-repeat, var(--color-pale-blue);
```

### Continued development

Though this is a small component to start with BEM, I will continue to develop myself. Also improve my knowledge on background one liner.

### Useful resources
